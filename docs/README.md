## **Description of the application**

Sports-4-Us is an App that that helps people from all walks of life, to **join** and **participate** in a wide variety of **sporting activities** of their *choice* and at times *flexible* for them.

The figure below shows how a user can typically use the Sport4Us app to eventually particiapte in activities.

![Sports4Us](docs/Description/Sports4Us.png)


### **Purpose**

The main purpose behind Sports-4-Us is to try build an Application that will make it easier for more people to  ***participate in sports***.

Studies show that living an active life style through sports participation generally improves lives of individuals in the following ways:

- Improved Mental Health and Social Wellness,
- Improved Physical Health and Fitness,
- Improved Sleep,
- Improved Energy Levels and
- Reduced risk of serious illnesses and chronic diseases.

All these factors improve the quality of life and the capacity of an individual to be more productive. Hence, with more individuals taking part in sports, it helps to build a **happier**, **healthier** and **more productive world** and one that will need less money to be spend on health services and health infrastructure. 

Despite all the well known benefits that come with sports participation, many individuals experience numerous barriers when trying to take part in sports. Some of the barriers experienced by individuals, as mentioned by the Australian Sports Commission *(Australian Sports Commission, 2022) are the following:

- **Time:** Families and individuals are getting busier by the day and finding less time to commit to sporting activities. Lot of sporting activities have very inflexible schedule that can be unsuitable for individuals involved in full time work and families.
- **Cost:** The cost to register for sports can be quite unaffordable for many individuals and families
- **Enjoyment:** Not everybody is drawn to sports that are competitive in nature and hence this might deter many individuals from taking part. Some people are looking for enjoyment and fitness only.
- **Self-Esteem:** Some individuals may not feel good enough for sports and hence might stay away from sports.
- **Risk:** Some people may feel that sports could be dangerous and stay away to risk injuries.
- **Awareness:** Individuals may not be aware of where the sporting activities are due to not being well connected socially.
- **Delivery:** Some sporting activities that are available might not be delivered well and informative enough for the general public feel interested.

Sports-4-Us tries to reduce all these barriers and increase participation by providing the following benefits:

- **Easily Accessible:** Sports-4-Us App will be easily accessible on the internet for anybody that can access the internet at no cost. This will ensure that almost all people and even people that were in the dark previously, with regard to sporting information can easily be aware. 
- **Affordable:** Joining fees and cost to join activities will be at a minimum because there is no need to employ too many people or maintain too much infrastructure for the sporting activities. Few admin personnel and sports organisers can service all the activities which keeps workers wages at a minimum. Facilities and programs are rented or accessed only when needed and hence there is no need to charge members high joining fees to maintain or buy facilities. 
- **Easy to Join:**  Joining only requires a very easy Sign up process and a minimal joining fee.
- **Informative:** The App will have extensive information on each activity which will ensure that people from all walks of live will be made fully aware of the details of each program and how that could fit into everybody’s personal lives. 
- **Flexibility:** For people that have time constraints and inflexible working hours, it works ideal because joining the app does not require a long term commitment to any activity. People can choose to join short term activities when they choose, withdraw after that and later join again when they are free again.
- **Easy to Contact:** The app provides contact forms and messaging Channels to communicate with administrators and organisers when quite easily. This will clear any doubts, issues or concerns people may have around things like self-esteem and risks.
- **Lots of Choice:** Joining the app allows the user to choose from a wide range of activities throughout their membership which allows them to experience various sports and opportunities to network with lots of different people.

A summary of everything mentioned so far is shown in the image below:

### **Functionality / features**

![features](docs/Description/features.png)

In order to understand the full functionality of Sport-4-Us App, it is important to examine it from the perspective of each of the four different types of users, that will be using the Application:

**Guest Users**

Guest Users are anybody that uses the Application and are not Signed up as a User and hence cannot Log In to the application under any capacity. These users can still use the application but to a much limited capacity. They can more specifically do the following:

- View the Home Page
- Explore through the different Categories of  Activities available and also the specific Activities within each category in detail.
- They can also contact the Administrators of the application by typing a message in the Contact Page.
- If they later decide to be a Member or an Organiser of the Activities, they can then Sign Up using the Sign up Page.

All the above features are what has been decided to be part of the ***Minimum Viable Product*** for design of the Application. Once all that has been implemented the developers hope to implement the following to enrich the Application:

- a payment system during Sign Up to ensure that the users can be charged a ‘Joining fee’ to secure membership.
- A Weather Forecast for the day each of the activity will take place.

**Members**

Members are the ones who will be choosing from the different activities available and eventually participating in them. To be more specific, they will have access to all the following features:


- All the features that are available to Guest Users,
- Signing In as a User,
- Booking suitable activity or activities,
- Paying for suitable activities to Participate
- Viewing Personal Messages from other members, organisers and Administrators,
- Messaging and replying to other members, organisers and Administrators using direct messaging,
- Posting messages in different Messaging channels
- Editing their Personal Profiles,
- Viewing list of Activities that they will be participating in.
- Viewing a list of all the Members and Organisers registered in the App.

**Organisers**

Organisers are the ones who will be in charge of organising the different activities and communicating with members regarding details of each activity. To be more specific, the will have access to all the following features:

- All the features that are available to Guest Users,
- Signing In as a User,
- Viewing Personal Messages from other members, organisers and Administrators,
- Messaging and replying to other members, organisers and Administrators using direct messaging,
- Posting messages in different Messaging channels
- Editing their Personal Profiles,
- Viewing list of Activities that they will are Organising.
- Viewing a list of all the Members and Organisers registered in the App.

All the above features are what has been decided to be part of the ***Minimum Viable Product*** for design of the Application. Once all that has been implemented the developers hope to implement the following to enrich the Application:

- The Organisers will be able to Create their own Activities and submit it to Administrators for Approval.
- They will have a page to view all the Activities that have been created but are still waiting to be approved by the Administrators.

**Administrators**

Administrators are the people that are responsible for administrative functions regarding the application. To be more specific they will have access to the following features:

- All features that are available to Guest users.
- Signing In as a User,
- Viewing Personal Messages from other members, organisers and Administrators,
- Messaging and replying to other members, organisers and Administrators using direct messaging,
- Posting messages in different Messaging channels
- Editing Personal Profiles of All users,
- Deleting Users
- Viewing a list of all the Members and Organisers registered in the App.
- Creating Activities
- Assigning Users as Members and Organisers,

All the above features are what has been decided to be part of the ***Minimum Viable Product*** for design of the Application. Once all that has been implemented the developers hope to implement the following to enrich the Application:

- Admin will be in a position to Accept or Reject Activities created by Organisers.
- Admin will be able to view a list of Activities that are waiting to be approved.

## **Dataflow Diagrams**

### **DFD for All Users**

![One](docs/DataFlowDiagrams/DFD1.png)

As shown above all users can view the Home Page, Sporting Categories, view Individual Category Activities, details of the Activities  and the Contact Page. All Activities data will be retrieved from the Activities Table in the Database. Data regarding the weather conditions will be retrieved from an external Weather API. However this is currently not part of the Minimum Viable Product Design.

### **DFD for Guest Users Only**

![2](docs/DataFlowDiagrams/DFD2.png)

As shown above Guest Users can sign up and send the data to be stored in a Users Table in the database. This data can also be retrieved to set the User to a Logged-in condition. During Sign up the app could be set up to charge a fee. This will would mean data will have to be sent to an externaly payment API. However this is currently not part of the Minimum Viable Product Design.

### **DFD for All Logged-In Users**

![3pt1](docs/DataFlowDiagrams/DFD3.1.png)

This shows how data can be sent to "Sign Out" a user and how a user can View the page that shows the full Members' list. Data for the Member's List is obtained from the Users Table in the database. After Sign out the user is taken to the Home page.

![3pt2pt3spt3](docs/DataFlowDiagrams/DFD3.2.3.3.png)

Figure 3.2 Shows how messages are read and posted in the messaging channels. Data here is stored and retrieved from the Messaging Channel table in the database.

Figure 3.3 Shows how personal messages are read from the Inbox table in the database. 

![3pt4pt3spt5](docs/DataFlowDiagrams/DFD3.4.3.5.png)

Figure 3.4 Shows how Personal messages can be read and replied to. All data is retrieved and stored from the Inbox table.

Figure 3.5 Shows how a new message can be composed and sent to another member. Again this message will be stored in the Inbox table in the database

![DFD4](docs/DataFlowDiagrams/DFD4.png)

This shows how a logged in User can Edit their profole. details in the Users table is retrieved, Edited and Stored.

### **DFD for Organiser Users**

![DFD5](docs/DataFlowDiagrams/DFD5.png)

This diagram show show Organisers can retrieve information on their organised activities from the Activities Table. It also shows a feature that is not MVP at the momment - Create Activity. This will be stored in a new table called "Pending Activity Table"

### **DFD for Member Users**

![DFD6](docs/DataFlowDiagrams/DFD6.png)

This shows how data flows to all the different tables in the database when Member users book activities and view activities they are participating in.

### **DFD for Admin Users**

![DFD7](docs/DataFlowDiagrams/DFD7.png)

This shows how data is stored into the Activities Table in the database after the Admin Creates Activities in the Create activity Page. It also shows how Admin can edit User Profiles from the Members' page by accessing and storing information from the Users table.

![DFD8](docs/DataFlowDiagrams/DFD8.png)

This feature that is currently not MVP will require information to be retrieved from a new table called "Pending Activity table"  and be stored in the Activity table in the database.

## **Application Architecture Diagram**

![ArcDiag](docs/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The one thing to note in the above Architecture Diagram is that the implementation of the system accessing the Weather API is not part of the MVP(Minimum Viable Product) design. It is a feature that will be implemented once all the MVP features have been sucessfully implemented.

## **Wireframes for multiple standard screen sizes, created using industry standard software**

This section shows all the wireframes that have been designed for Sports4Us App. The wireframes have been separated into four sections:

- Wireframes - User Not Logged-In
- Wireframes - Member Login
- Wireframes - Organiser Login
- Wireframes - Admin Login

Each section will first provide a sitemap on how the webpages will 'flow' under the logged in/not logged-in condition and then the wireframes for each of the webpages shown in the sitemap will be displayed in order. However if any of the webpages in the sitemap is a repeat and had been shown before, then it will not be repeated again.

### **A. Wireframes - User Not Logged-In**

![notLoggedIn](docs/SiteMaps/SMnotLoggedIn.png)

As shown in the sitemap any user can access "All Activity Categories", "Contact" and "Sign-up" from the Home Page. Any user can perform a sign up to access a Member Dashboard page. In the future a payment system for Sign up will be implemented, however as shown this is not part of the MVP currently. The user can also gain access to a page showing the different categories of sports and from here the user can access a page with more detailed information on each Sporting Activity.

**1 - Home Page**

![HomePage](docs/Wireframes/NLhomePage.png)

The home page will have some sporting images in the background with buttons and links to all the pages accessible from the home page, as shown in the site map. The navbar on top will change to a hamburger menu on the mobile view, which will be the case in all the wireframes.

**2 - All Activity Categories**

![allActiivityCategories](docs/Wireframes/NLallActivityCategories.png)

## **Screenshots of your Trello board throughout the duration of the project**

In order to manage this project appropriately throughout the design and implementation process, the team has chossen to use Trello, which is a Software package that serves as Project Management tool.

The team has created two different boards to track and update the progress of the project:

- **Final Project Part A** Board: This will track and update the progress of the project in the Design phase of the project.
- **Final Project Part B** Board: This will track and update the progress of the project in the Implementation and Final Deployment phase of the project.
